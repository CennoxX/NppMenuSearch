Installation
------------

Put `NppMenuSearch.dll` into the `plugins\` subfolder of the Notepad++ installation folder.

Usage
-----

The plugin adds a text box to the Notepad++ toolbar. 

* Use Ctrl+M or the mouse to select it.
* Type some characters, e.g. "number con".
    As you type, a drop-down list of found menu items appears.
* UP and DOWN keys can be used to navigate through the drop-down list
* TAB switches between the menu items list and the preference dialog items list.
* ESC abandons the search.
* ENTER executes the currently selected menu item and closes the drop-down list.
    If a preferences dialog item was selected, the preferences dialog with that item highlighted.
* There is a menu item to repeat the most recently used command. You should assign a keyboard 
    shortcut to this if you use need it often. This would effectively save you two keystrokes.
